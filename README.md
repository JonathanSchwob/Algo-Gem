# Algo-Gem


A gem that overwrites the Array class and is able to implement different type methods quickly so the user can choose which is made for the best case scenario.

###Algorithm Methods

<br>
Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.

<br>
The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

##Algorithms

I am also storing algorithms I have stumbled upon and have given me difficulty.
<br>I encourage anyone to add challenging algorithm problems on the Algortihms Directory.
