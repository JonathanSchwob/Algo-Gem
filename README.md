# Algo-Gem


A gem that overwrites the Array class and is able to implement different type methods quickly so the user can choose which is made for the best case scenario.

###Algorithm Methods

Quick Sort
<br>
Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.

##Algorithms

I am also storing algorithms I have stumbled upon and have given me difficulty.
<br>I encourage anyone to add challenging algorithm problems on the Algortihms Directory.
