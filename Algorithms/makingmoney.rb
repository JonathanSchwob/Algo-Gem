# Write a function that, given:
#1. an amount of money
#2. an array of coin denominations
# computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

# Example:
# 4 cents is equal to:
# 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
# 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
# 1¢, 3¢
# 2¢, 2¢

# for amount=44 (44¢) and denominations=[1,2,3][1,2,3] (11¢, 22¢ and 33¢),
# your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:
