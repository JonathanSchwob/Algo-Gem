// Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

// which would return true if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and false otherwise?
// How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time?

// Here's a picture of what a list with a loop looks like:

// 1 -> 2 -> 3-> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3
