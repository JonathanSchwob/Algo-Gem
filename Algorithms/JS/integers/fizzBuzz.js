// Write a program that iterates the integers from 1 to 100, printing the numbers to the screen.
// For each number that is a multiple of 3, however, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
// For multiples of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number.
// For numbers that are multiples of both print "FizzBuzz."
