// Suppose youâ€™d like to traverse through a family tree in JavaScript, printing each generation of children on a single line.

// Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
// It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1])
// and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
