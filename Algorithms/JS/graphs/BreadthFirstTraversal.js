/*
 *     For the example graph below, what is the expected output if we printed each
 *     vertex value from vertex A outwards using:
 *
 *     a. BREADTH FIRST traversal?
 *
 *     NOTE: Assume the order of edges will be alphabetical. E.g., Vertex D has edges to
 *           5 vertices in the following order: B, C, E, F, G
 *
 *     NOTE: The traversal should take care of redundancy and not print the same vertex
 *           value twice.
 *
 *     Example Graph:
 *
 *              B     E
 *            /   \  /
 *          A       D  --- F
 *            \   /   \   /
 *              C       G
