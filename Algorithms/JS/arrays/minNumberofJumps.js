/*
 *     Given an array of non-negative integers, starting at the first index of the array.
 *     Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *     What is the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index?
 *
 *  Input: Array of non-negative integers
 *  Output: Integer
 *
 *  Example: jump([2,3,1,1,4])
 *  Result: 2 because traveling from 2 -> 3 -> 4 uses 2 jumps
