// Given an arrayOfInts, find the highestProduct you can get from three of the integers.

// The input arrayOfInts will always have at least three integers.

// Does your function work with negative numbers?

// If arrayOfInts is [-10, -10, 1, 3, 2][−10,−10,1,3,2]
// we should return 300 (which we get by taking -10 * -10 * 3−10∗−10∗3).
