# Get Nth Leaf

# Let's say we have the following tree:

#           A
#       B        C
#     D E F    G   H
#             J K
# Our goal is to write a method get_nth_leaf that finds the nth leaf in the tree when performing an in-order depth-first traversal.

# def get_nth_leaf(num)

# end

# get_nth_leaf(0) - D
# get_nth_leaf(3) - J
# get_nth_leaf(5) - H
